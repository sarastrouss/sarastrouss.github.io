As Publicity Director of WREK Atlanta, I worked on several different advertisement campaigns for WREK Atlantaâ€™s annual benefit concert, speciality shows, community events, and general station ads. One of my favorite works from this time is a general station ad that was designed to work in both print and online. The bouquet of flowers was illustrated by Tyler Smith. I filled in the illustration and designed the ad using <b>Photoshop</b>. This ad has been featured in print in [The Technique](https://nique.net) and [Creative Loafing](https://clatl.com).
