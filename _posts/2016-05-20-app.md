<b>Problem</b>: Taking information from recent survey data, we found that while the majority of our users listen to WREK on the radio, there is a decent number of listeners that access WREK online. Whether that be to listen to archived shows or listen live, we wanted to move towards providing a way for listeners to listen on their phones. In addition, we wanted to further cater to our listeners that live outside of our broadcast range.

<b>Process</b>

This project is still in process and currently, I'm in charge of the Home Page. Pulling from our website, www.wrek.org, and google analytics data from the website, I was about to pinpoint a few starting features. 

- Upcoming Shows
- Upcoming Events (concerts in Atlanta and Live at WREK shows)
- Top shows for a given week
- Currently playing (widget that follows throughout the app)
- Featured Show

<u>Lo-Fi Wireframes</u>

Settling on a design, but still working on justification of what style of menu to use.

After some deliberation and further research, the hamburger menu isn't the best menu for the use cases of the WREK app. One of the primary reasons for this is that there are only four main menu items, so in this case hiding them behind a hamburger menu isn't ideal. We want our users to be able to quickly to move from the home page to their favorites page to the schedule.

However, as this is a project still in progress, in order to finalize the design, we will be working with the above wireframes and begin testing to see which really work for our target users.
