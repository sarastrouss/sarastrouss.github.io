For one of the projects in Construct of the Moving Image, we were given the task of creating a music animation in Processing. Instead of manually finding the beat of the song, I used Minim and Beat Detection libraries to accomplish this. Repo can be viewed [here](https://github.com/sarastrouss/musicanimation).
