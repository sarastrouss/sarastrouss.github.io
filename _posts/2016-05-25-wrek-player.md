<b>Problem</b>: WREK Atlanta's Wordpress site, ([WREK.org](https://wrek.org)), has come a long way from what it looked like [back in 2001](http://web.archive.org/web/20011127061215/http://www.wrek.org/). Even so, the most recent redesign took place in 2013, and the Live Player was an Adobe Flash widget with no phone-friendly fallback until 2015. I'm leading a redesign of the player to address listener feedback and improve the overall experience. Key elements of the new player: 

- Easier access to show descriptions and playlist history
- Mobile friendly while maintaining features such as live-updating "Now Playing" text
- Optional, rather than mandatory pop-out player

<u>Current Implementation</u>

When the user presses the volume icon on the WREK homepage, a pop-up player window opens. In addition, each link featured on the player takes the user to another page on wrek.org.

While the current player's design does reuse some elements from the homepage such as the Song Request widget, it still feels inconsistent across desktop and mobile, and there are a few strange CSS quirks on tablets.

<b>Process</b>

To begin, I started by wireframing several different potential layouts for the player that would appear on wrek.org. I started off with a similar layout to the current one and moved from there.

The final player design puts focus on the what is currently happening on air. The user can change the volume, bring up a short playlist that changes the content in the player widget, and pop out the player into another window. 

<b>Main Proposed Changes</b>

- Player does not automatically pop out, but plays immediately after the user selects the play button.

- User can change between on-air, HD-1, and HD-2 stations through the provided menu. 

- There is a reinforced show identity by highlighting the showâ€™s icon on the web player.

- Including the social media icons and contact at the bottom of the player frees up space on wrek.org.
