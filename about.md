I recently graduated from Georgia Tech's Computational Media program in December. Computational Media is a mix between Computer Science and HCI. At Tech, I spent a lot of time working with WREK Atlanta. I ran two radio shows, my own personal shift and Live at WREK, and acted as the Publicity Director and General Manager. Aside from WREK and classes, I spend my free time going to concerts, developing info visualizations, and hanging out with my cat Clover. I'm currently living in Seattle.
